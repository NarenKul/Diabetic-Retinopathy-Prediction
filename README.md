# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Prediction
A Neural Network built on Keras using Sequential Model to predict whether a person has Diabetic Retinopathy or not.

Model = `Sequential`

Layers = `4`

Activation Layout = `relu->tanh->relu->sigmoid`

Output layer has been set to sigmoid to get uniform outputs of 0 or 1

Optimizer = `adam`
