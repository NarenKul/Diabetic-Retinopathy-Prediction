# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Prediction
A Neural Network built on Keras using Sequential Model to predict whether a person has Diabetic Retinopathy or not.

Model : `Sequential`

Layers : `4`

Activation Layout : `relu->relu->sigmoid`

Output layer has been set to sigmoid to get uniform outputs of 0 or 1

Optimizer : `adam`

This model can be used for binary classification with dataset containing *no string* values.

Train Accuracy : `85%`

Test Accuracy : `76%`

Dataset used : Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen Data Set

Next Steps : Implement a model to increase accuracy and reduce bias.
